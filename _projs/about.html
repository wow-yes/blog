"Voilà! In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran, cast vicariously as both
victim and villain by the vicissitudes of Fate. This visage, no mere
veneer of vanity, is it vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished,
as the once vital voice of the verisimilitude now venerates what they
once vilified. However, this valorous visitation of a bygone vexation
stands vivified, and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent
vermin vanguarding vice and vouchsafing the violently vicious and
voracious violation of volition. The only verdict is vengeance; a
vendetta held as a votive, not in vain, for the value and veracity of
such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous. Verily, this
vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose vis-à-vis an introduction,
and so it is my very good honor to meet you and you may call me V."
